This project is my first project and I have initialised git.

Git commands:
- Git status: It helps you check the status of the last commit you did.
- 'echo README.txt' or 'touch README.txt': is what creates the Readme.txt file inside the repo.
- cat >> README.txt: use this if you want to add content to the readme file.
- git log: shows you log of all the commits that has been made.
- git reset HEAD: points you to where the last commit error is in your project
- rm *.html: This means to remove all .html files in your directory
- git pull origin master: This pulls from github into master branch

Say you mistakenly delete a file in your directory, do:
- git checkout -- home.html to recover the file home.html
- git checkout *.html

BRANCH
- git branch add-about: This creates the branch "add-about"
- git checkout -b add-about: This creates the branch "add-about" and switches you into the branch
- git checkout add-about: This switches your work environment into the "add-about" branch

when pushing a new branch from your computer to your github, do "git push origin branch_name"
